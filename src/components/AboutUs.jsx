  The Web Dev Club at GTBIT is a student-led community where we learn and build 
  together. Through weekly hands-on workshops and real-world projects, beginners 
  and experienced coders alike can sharpen their skills. With mentorship and teamwork, 
  youâ€™ll create portfolio-ready websites, collaborate with peers, and prepare for 
  internships that launch your developer journey.
